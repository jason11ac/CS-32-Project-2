# Linked-List-Program

This program is a cricular, doubly linked list called Sequence that uses typedef to either hold strings or unsigned long integers. The list has a dummy node at the beginning and has a variety of useful functions that manipulate the Sequence. My main file has tests for both strings and unisigned longs, but the two can not run together as that would result in type errors.
